# Phonebook
The phonebook project is an excercise to show front end capabilities, the idea was to create an app that could list contacts ({firstName, lastName, phoneNumber}), that could add contacts and could search contacts.

The excercise was originally for Java developers, so it was adjusted to front development.
_This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9._

## Setup

- Download/fork this project into your local
- run `npm install`
- run `npm install -g typescript` if Typescript is not installed in the local env.
- run `npm run build` (_if you notice some lint errors, don't mind them it has to do to Typescript versions_)
- run `npm start`
- browse [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

You should see a view like :
